Narrative:

The story takes place in an apocalyptic era, where humanity is near to the end, while the remains of the humanity has became a savage.

You was outdoors, hunting for food and anything worth scavaging, as you and your group were starving, and did not have eat any food in for many days.

While you were scavanging, you came across a tent in a dead forest, with no sign of natural foliage or savage people, you decided to investigate the camp, until, you got caught in a snare trap, pulling you up to a tree branch.

A few seconds after, you got knocked out of conscious by a unidentified person. You woke up in an abandoned building. Floor creaking, ceiling crumbling, dust surrounding the room. You start to analyse the room to see what you can use to cut the rope ties. After a minute, you find a sharp but broken metal railing that you use to cut the ties and make your way out...
